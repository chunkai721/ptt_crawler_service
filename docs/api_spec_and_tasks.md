## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application, initializes the Crawler, LineInterface, and Database objects, and handles the start and stop commands."),
    ("crawler.py", "Contains the Crawler class, which is responsible for scraping data from PTT. It should be implemented first as it is the core functionality of the service."),
    ("line_interface.py", "Contains the LineInterface class, which is responsible for sending and receiving messages via LINE. It depends on the Crawler class to provide the data to be sent."),
    ("database.py", "Contains the Database class, which is responsible for storing and retrieving data. It depends on the Crawler class to provide the data to be stored."),
    ("config.py", "Contains the configuration variables for the application. It should be implemented first as it is needed by all other classes.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.py",
    "crawler.py",
    "database.py",
    "line_interface.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config.py' contains the configuration variables for the application, such as the LINE bot API key, the SQLite database path, and the PTT board and keyword settings.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
There is no unclear point in the given context. The main entry point of the application is 'main.py', and all third-party libraries are initialized in their respective classes.
